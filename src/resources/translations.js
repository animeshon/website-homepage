                            independent Japanese Manga artists. We build a bridge between users in the world
                            and Manga artists in Japan and offer a place where both of them can support each
                            other.`,

                            question: 'What are Animeshon\'s ideals?',
                            answer: `We believe in the boundary between people which cry, laugh and love the wonderfull stories of the Anime & Manga culture.
                            We believe in an community where people which share this boundary support and interact with each other, creating new stories.
                            The anime, manga, and light novel communities still have much potential to grow, and we at Animeshon will work as hard as possible to provide the optimal environment for the prosperity of these communities.`,
